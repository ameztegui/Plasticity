\usage{
rdpi(dataframe, sp, trait, factor, verbose = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataframe}{The dataframe that contains the data}

\item{sp}{The bare (unquoted) name of the column whose values will be used as independent variable.
The function will compare RDPI values among values of this variable. It can be species, provenances, etc.}

\item{trait}{The bare (unquoted) name of the column that holds the trait for which to calculate RDPI. Must be numeric}

\item{factor}{the bare (unquoted) name of the column that holds the environmental factor for which we will calculate RDPI. 
By definition, RDPI computes distances between pairs of observations that are at different levels of this factor.}

\item{verbose}{defines if we want to get a data frame with all the individual RDPI values calculated.
By default is set to `TRUE`; indicating that we will get the data frame. If set to `FALSE`, we only get a summary table and a bocplot}
}
\value{
This function computes RDPI to the environmental factor for each species of the dataset(or any other identifying variable defined in `sp`)
Then it makes an ANOVA or t-test of the values of RDPI across species
and plots the boxplot
